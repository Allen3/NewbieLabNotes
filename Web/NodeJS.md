# Node.js

Basically, *Node* is **evented** and **asynchronous**.

There actually is an acronym for the types of applications Node is designed for: **DIRT**y. It stands for *Data-Intensive Real-Time* applications. 

> *PLATFORM* v.s. *FRAMEWORK*

> Node is a platform for JavaScript applications, and itâ€™s not to be confused with a framework. A popular framework for Node called **Express** later will be covered in this book.

In browser, we often use *jQuery* to make an Ajax request while in server end, *Node* can handle this. 

Some examples are:
* [A simple asynchronous example](/tests/nodejs/asyncDemo.js)
* [A simple http image server](/tests/nodejs/imageServer.js)
